Data Analytics Project: Sales Data Analysis and Reporting Overview
This project demonstrates the process of Data analysis, Data cleaning, and Data visualization. The project includes the following key steps:
Loading a dataset into Python for initial exploration.
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and anomalies.
Cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure consistency.
Running SQL queries on MySQL Server to extract relevant insights.
Building an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics.
Creating a report and PPT using Gamma for presenting the findings.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of sales data with multiple attributes such as date, region, product, and revenue. This dataset was loaded into Python and SQL databases to perform in-depth analysis.
Key Columns: Product, Sales, Region, Date, Quantity, Customer_ID
Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy) – for data cleaning and EDA
SQL (MySQL Server) – for data querying and aggregation
Power BI – for creating interactive visualizations
Gamma – for creating reports and presentations
Steps
Data Loading & Exploration:
Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas for exploration.
Conducted EDA to understand distributions, outliers, and correlations.
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing data and performed necessary transformations.
Removed duplicates and handled inconsistent data formats.
SQL Analysis:
Used SQL queries to aggregate sales data by region, product, and date.
Performed advanced queries, including window functions, joins, and aggregations to derive insights.
Building the Dashboard:
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard visualizing key metrics such as total sales, top-performing products, and regional performance.
Added slicers and filters for user interactivity.
Report and Presentation:
Generated a detailed report summarizing findings.
Created a PPT using Gamma for presenting the analysis to stakeholders.
Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides a dynamic, interactive view of the following metrics:
Sales Trends: Monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends.
Top Products: Best-selling products by region.
Regional Insights: Performance comparison between regions.
Customer Segmentation: Insights into customer buying patterns.
Results
The analysis provided actionable insights, including:
Identification of top-performing products and regions.
Trends showing seasonal fluctuations in sales.
Recommendations for increasing sales in underperforming regions.
Actionable data visualizations and trends that helped drive business decisions.
